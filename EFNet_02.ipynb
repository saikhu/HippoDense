    "One method for trying to visualise why the network made a given prediction is occlusion sensitivity. We occlude part of the image, and see how the probability of a given prediction changes. We then iterate over the image, moving the occluded portion as we go, and in doing so we build up a sensitivity map detailing which areas were the most important in making the decision.\n",

    "If we were to test the occlusion centred on all voxels in our image, we would have to do `torch.prod(im.shape) = 96^3 = ~1e6` predictions. We can use the bounding box to only to the estimations in a region of interest, for example over one slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we simply give the bounding box as `(minC,maxC,minD,maxD,minH,maxH,minW,maxW)`. We can use `-1` for any value to use its full extent (`0` and `im.shape-1` for min's and max's, respectively).\n",
